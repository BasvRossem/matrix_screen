# Matrix Screen

That one part of the matrix with the symbols falling from above. It is made in javascript.

I was looking around on YouTube the other day and found the youtube channel Coding Train (a very fun channel to watch, I highly recommend them). On this channel, Emily Xie made a guest appearance and created a matrix-like effect. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1TQCi9axzg). It looks quite cool, but some people in the comments mentioned that the letters in the matrix don't "rain down", but rather they are statically placed and the character changes to the new spot. I took this as a challenge and made my own version of the Matrix effect, partially following Emily's instructions.

The sketch makes use of the p5 library.
